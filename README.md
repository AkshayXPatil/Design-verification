UVM and Systemverilog based test benches for functional verification of a RAM module
- I did this project to learn state of the art verification methodologies used in the industry.
- The project is aimed at developing Systemverilog and UVM test benches for the functional verification of a RAM module.
- [ram.v](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Design-verification/blob/master/ram.v) is the verilog description of the ram module (UUT/DUT).
- [ram_tb.sv](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Design-verification/blob/master/ram_tb.sv) is the systemverilog based test bench for the ram module.
- [testbench.sv](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Design-verification/blob/master/testbench.sv) is the the UVM based test bench for the ram module.
- [interface.sv](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Design-verification/blob/master/interface.sv) is the pin level interface of the ram module which is used across both the test benches.
