UVM and Systemverilog based test benches for functional verification of a RAM module
- I did this project to learn state of the art verification methodologies used in the industry.
- The project is aimed at developing Systemverilog and UVM test benches for the verification of a RAM module.
- ram.v is the verilog description of the ram module (UUT/DUT).
- ram_tb.sv is the systemverilog based test bench for the ram module.
- testbench.sv is the the UVM based test bench for the ram module.
- interface.sv is the pin level interface of the ram module which is used across both the test benches.
